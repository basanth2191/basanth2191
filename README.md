# Hi  <img src = "https://github.com/basanth2191/basanth2191/blob/main/wave.gif" width = "30px" >

I am <b> Basanth Shankar </b> and welcome to my page.

A little about me,

-  👀 I love analyzing why things work the way they work and how it can be done more efficiently. I am fascinated by topics such as machine learning, dimension reduction, and transformation of statistical distributions since they simplify the work in finding answers.
- 🌱 I am currently learning web-scrapping and plan to learn cloud computing next.
- 🤝 Feel free to contact me or add me on linkedin if you would like to share ideas or work or learn together.

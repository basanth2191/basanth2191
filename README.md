<h2> Hi 👋 </h2>

I am Basanth Shankar and welcome to my page.

A little about me,

-  👀 I love analyzing why things work the way they work and how it can be done more efficiently. I am fascinated by topics such as machine learning, dimension reduction, and transformation of statistical distributions since they simplify the work in finding answers.
- 🌱 I am currently learning web-scrapping and plan to learn cloud computing next.
- 🤝 Feel free to contact me if you would like to share ideas or work together.
